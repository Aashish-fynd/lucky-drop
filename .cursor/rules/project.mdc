# 🎁 Gift-by-Luck App – Implementation Summary

Gift-by-Luck is a surprise gifting app built with usign Next.js, Shadcn, Tailwind, and Firebase. It allows a gifter (authenticated user) to create a gift drop—a list of 3–5 gift options with predefined actions (e.g., “Send via Amazon”). The recipient accesses the gift via a link or QR code, with no login required, and receives one gift either randomly or by choice.

👥 User Roles:
Gifter: Creates drops, adds gift actions, and can include extras like status cards, voice/video notes.
Recipient: Accesses the drop, opens the gift, and enters delivery info if needed.

🧭 Gifter Flow:
Logs in → Creates drop with title, message, gifts, and mode (random/select)
Drop saved to Firestore → Unique ID and QR/link generated.
Can add media (images, videos, audio) to the drop which then will be shown to the recipient as swipeable cards before claiming.

🎉 Recipient Flow:
Visits link or scans QR → Sees surprise UI
Gift is revealed with animation → enters name/address if required
Optional: add selfie/audio reaction

☁️ Functions:
Gift Logic: Prevents duplicate claims, handles random/selected assignment, saves metadata
Notifies gifter about fulfillment

🔐 Auth & Access:
Gifter: Firebase Auth
Recipient: Anonymous access via unique link

Post-Claim Dashboard:
Gifter sees drop status, gift details, recipient info, and uploaded reactions
📣 Notifications:
Cloud Functions notify gifter via email or push when gift is claimed or fulfilled
